<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 🛠️ About The Project

This course is designed to teach you how to harness the power of AI on the Raspberry Pi, with a particular focus on using an AI kit to perform essential computer vision tasks. Throughout the course, you'll learn how to integrate AI into real-world IoT (Internet of Things) applications, from object detection and image classification to more complex visual recognition tasks. We will guide you step-by-step through setting up your Raspberry Pi, using AI frameworks, and deploying these models in various practical scenarios. Whether you are a hobbyist, a student, or a professional, this course will provide you with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to bring AI-driven solutions to life on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi.
